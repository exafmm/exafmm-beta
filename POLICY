[Priority]
1. Performance
 - Only optimize hot-spots
 - Keep everything else simple
2. Simplicity
 - Never show-off language skills
 - Take time to simplify code
3. Portability
 - Don't use tools that aren't available everywhere
 - Performance must be portable

[Variable name convention]
Use all captial for
 - Macro variables
 - Environtment values
 - Makefile variables
 - Struct elements
Start with captial for
 - Class & Struct names
 - User defined types
Start with small case for everything else
Use camel case
Avoid abbreviation as much as possible
 - Short scope, short name
 - Use plural for vectors (e.g. vector<cell> cells;)
 - For equations use the same characters
Common characters (prefix)
 - d* : Difference
 - i* : Loop counter
 - k* : Waves
 - n* : Size
 - X* : Coordinates
Common postfix
 - *i : target
 - *j : source
 - *p : parent
 - *c : child
 - *0 : first element
 - *N : last element
Common three letter keywords (prefix)
 - max* : Maximum
 - num* : Size
 - old* : Previous value
 - sum* : Sum
 - tmp* : Temporary value
 - vec* : Short vector type
Common keywords (postfix)
 - *begin & *end (following STL)
 - *send & *recv (following MPI)
 - *displ & *count (following MPI)
 - *global & *local (for distributed memory)
 - *min & *max
 - *key & *color
GPU memory keywords (postfix)
 - *glob : Global memory
 - *shrd : Shared memory

[C++ usage]
Use STL vectors but not iterators
 - Reserve, resize, and size are useful
 - Some compilers have difficulty parallelizing iterator loops
Use operator overloading for short vector types
 - Avoids a lot of indexing errors for short vectors
 - Makes the code cleaner
 - Portability of intrinsics
Use static & const for inner kernels
 - Prevents bugs
 - Const-correctness propagates
